# vkWavesDFT

It is now basically a well organized version of Discrete Fourier Transformation Ocean Wave. 
The base project (base.lib) from the SaschaWillems examples codebase was used as a framework to provide a wrapper of Vulkan APIs.

It is very slowly due to the algorithm. If the GPU is good (30xx) then it may work a little bit better.
Further I will update it to the Fast Fourier Transform algorithm.
